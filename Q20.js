//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var chocolates = ["DAIRYMILK", "KITKAT", "SNICKERS", "PERK", "GALAXY"];
console.log("list of chocolates:");
